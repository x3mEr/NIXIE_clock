**2020.06.15**

- upd: default settings changed.
- upd: some comments were translated.
- fix: typos.

**2019.12.2**

- add: added minimum ba—Åklight brightness for day and night.
- upd: now analogWrite() is used insted of setPWM() from GyverHacks lib. setPWM() does not turn off the PWM, so backlight was always on. It looks cool, but now, after introducing minimum backlight brightness, analogWrite() can be used for proper work.

**2019.12.2**

- add: backlight night step "BACKL_STEP_N" introduced. Improving the previous update (backlight night timer), to make the baklight's bright change more smooth at nighttime.
- add: new flip effect "glitchy flip" added.

**2019.11.30**

- add: backlight night timer introduced. At nighttime, when the baklight brightness is low, it changes with steps. To make bright change smooth, the baklight's cycle duration could be shorter than at daytime.

**2019.11.28**

- fix: after code optimisation in 2019.11.17 update bug with alarm appeared. It was impossible to turn it off with button SET regardless of board type (with or without toggle switch).

**2019.11.17**

- fix: disabled unwanted buttons clicks for different clock modes. Before this update, it was possible, for example, to go to settings or changes backlight mode while alarming, turn glitches off in "set alarm" mode...
- upd: modeTimer is reset after flipping effect to stay in "showClock" mode.

**2019.11.15**

- fix: if RTC is slower than time computation on arduino with dotTimer, this caused freezes (and even crashes), repeatedly running synchronization (in some sense, it is similar to limits in mathematical analysis). Now synchronization is limited to once every 30 min.

**2019.11.13**

- fix: backlight brightness changes according to daytime (in case of night mode is activated). Bug appeared after 2019.10.06 update, when backlBrightCounter = backlMaxBright or 0 was moved from bright.ino to buttonsSettings.ino.
- fix: flipTimer resets at effect initialization.
- upd: effects 4 (train) and 5 (elastic band) improved: now digits, not anodes, move along the indicators.
- upd: for alarm beeper in timeTicker.ino setPin() from GyverHacks lib is used (insted of digitalWrite()).

**2019.11.06**

- add: settings are stored in EEPROM now.
- add: added 2 flip effects: train and elastic band).
- upd: mode ("show time" and "show temp") changes after flip effect ends.
- fix: fixed bug with speed of flip effect after changing it - previoulsy the speed remained the same. It turned out it was hardcoded.
- upd: now backlMaxBright and 0 apply only once (while changing with middle button) - moved from bright.ino to buttonsSettings.ino.

**2019.09.25**

- add: "show temp" mode can be switched on/off with hold "+" button.

**2019.09.12**

- add: added DHT22 support (data pin - pin 13 by default).

**2019.09.09**

- fix: condition of brightness change: hrs < NIGHT_END (strictly less).
- add: alarm added. 2 variants are available - software switch and toggle switch (GND - toggle switch - pin 1 by default).
